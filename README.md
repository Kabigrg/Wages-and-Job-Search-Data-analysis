This project is designed to make scraper function take a list of URLs as input, scrapes information from these URLs, specifically athlete names and their heights, and returns a Pandas DataFrame with this information. It also calculates the mean height of the athletes and replaces any missing (NaN) values with this mean value. I also used other functions to find the top 5 tallest and shortest players on all four categories. I then sent all the four dataframes to csv file. After that, I made a dataframe to compare all four dataframes with their average. Lastly, I created bar plot to show average heights for all four dataframes
